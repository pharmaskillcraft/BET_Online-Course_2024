lysate derived from the blood cells of horseshoe crabs. This lysate contains proteins sensitive to the presence of endotoxins, particularly lipopolysaccharides (LPS) found in Gram-negative bacteria. When the test sample, possibly containing endotoxins, is mixed with the lysate, a reaction is initiated. If endotoxins are present in the sample, they activate a pathway within the lysate known as the coagulation pathway. This pathway triggers a cascade of biochemical reactions, ultimately leading to the conversion of soluble coagulogen into insoluble coagulin fibers. As these fibers aggregate and cross-link, they form a gel-like clot within the test tube. This clot, visible to the naked eye, indicates the presence of endotoxins in the sample. Thus, by observing the formation or absence of gel within a specified incubation period, the bacterial endotoxin test can reliably detect the presence or absence of endotoxins in pharmaceutical products and medical devices, ensuring their safety and quality.</span></p>","vectortext":{"left":0,"top":0,"right":843,"bottom":445,"pngfb":false,"pr":{"l":"Lib","i":556}}}],"shapemaskId":"","xPos":64,"yPos":78,"tabIndex":1,"tabEnabled":true,"xOffset":0,"yOffset":0,"rotateXPos":424,"rotateYPos":226,"scaleX":100,"scaleY":100,"alpha":100,"depth":3,"scrolling":true,"shuffleLock":false,"data":{"hotlinkId":"","accState":0,"vectorData":{"left":0,"top":0,"right":848,"bottom":452,"altText":"In the bacterial endotoxin test using the gel clot method, gel formation occurs because of a series of interactions between the sample being tested and a lysate derived from the blood cells of horseshoe crabs.
